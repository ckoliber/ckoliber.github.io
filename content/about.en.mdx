I am a Full-Stack programmer and computer science student, interested in cognitive science and genetics, a true lover of learning who has always sought more experience. <br />
I entered the field of programming in 2012, initially with the aim of implementing an audio and video messaging software, I started to learn the concepts of network and server and programming languages, the result of this goal was the ChaM project and a world of new experiences that It helped me find my career path and focus on the Backend field. <br />
After learning and doing a few Full-Stack projects, I gradually became familiar with Serverless architecture and LowCode and NoCode technologies, as well as the concepts of cloud computing. <br />
Because in my view programming is merely a tool to serve humanity, I try to spend less time programming with NoCode tools and instead spend more time learning basic concepts like math, logic and genetics. To.
