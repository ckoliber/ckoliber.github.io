### Mandegar Alborz High School

**2012 - 2016**

In 2012, I entered Alborz High School and after completing my studies in mathematics and physics in 2016, I graduated with a grade point average of 18.80 out of 20.  
This was the starting point for my interest in trying to learn programming with the goal of implementing ChaM messengers, so it was a turning point in my life, and it led me to personally learn the basics of programming.
