In 2012, I entered Alborz High School and after completing my studies in mathematics and physics in 2016, I graduated with a grade point average of 18.80 out of 20. <br />
This was the starting point for my interest in trying to learn programming with the goal of implementing ChaM messengers, so it was a turning point in my life, and it led me to personally learn the basics of programming.
