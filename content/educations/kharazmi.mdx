description: Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that
    a reader will be distracted by the readable content
    of a page when looking at its layout. The point of
    using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
    normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
    'Content here, content here', making it look like
    readable English. Many desktop publishing packages
    and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their
    default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum'
    will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
    Various versions have evolved over the years,
    sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
    (injected humour and the like).
