### Backend Developer - TIS Co

I worked part-time at the private company "TIS" for 15 months as a Backend developer. <br />
During this period, I worked as a NodeJS programmer in the "Managed Funds System (MFD)" project at the request of the "Ports and Maritime Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran".
