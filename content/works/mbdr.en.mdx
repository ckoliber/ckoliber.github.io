I worked part-time at the private company "MobtakerDarya" for 12 months as a programmer in the field of FullStack. <br />
During this period, I was involved in the projects of Container Goods Control System (CCS) at the request of the Ports and Maritime Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran as a NodeJS programmer and Shahin System at the request of the Persian Gulf Blue Sea Company.
