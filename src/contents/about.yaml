summary: |-
    I am a Full-Stack developer and computer science M.Sc. student, interested in cognitive science and brain signals processing, and a true lover of learning who has always sought more experience. I entered the field of programming in 2012, initially with the aim of implementing audio and video messaging software, I started to learn the concepts of networking and programming languages, and the result of this goal was the ChaM (Chapar Messenger) project and a world of new experiences that It helped me find my career path and focus on the backend field. After learning and doing a few Full-Stack projects, I gradually became familiar with serverless architecture and Low-Code and No-Code technologies, as well as the concepts of cloud computing.  
    Because in my view, programming is merely a tool to serve humanity, I try to spend less time programming with No-Code tools and instead spend more time learning basic concepts like math, logic, and AI.
