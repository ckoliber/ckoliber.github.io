With over a decade of development experience since 2013, I am a DevOps and MLOps engineer specializing in scalable infrastructure for AI systems. My expertise spans CI/CD optimization, Dockerization, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC), having streamlined deployments for systems managing millions of daily transactions. As part of my master's program in AI, I am focused on advancing MLOps, automating model training and inference, and exploring Large Language Model (LLM) operations.
