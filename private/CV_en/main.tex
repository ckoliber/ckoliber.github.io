I'm a DevOps engineer with over 5 years of experience, specializing in CI/CD pipeline implementation, Dockerization, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) across teams of 10+ engineers. I've optimized deployments for systems handling millions of daily transactions. While my focus is on DevOps, I'm also exploring MLOps, particularly in automating model training and inference.
